This is a VSCode plugin to help you quickly configure rules for the Cline / Roo AI programming assistant. It supports managing rules in a project-specific `.clinerules/` or `.roo/` directory, as well as a central "Rule Bank" for templates.

  - General Rules
    - General: Basic rules applicable to all projects
- **Flexible Rule Management**:
  - **Project Rules**: Manage rules directly within your project in a `.clinerules/rules` or `.roo/rules` directory.
  - **Rule Bank**: Use a central repository of rule templates that you can add to any project.
  - **Create and Edit**: Easily create new project-specific rules or edit existing ones.
- **Easy Setup**: If no rule directory exists, the extension will offer to create one for you.

## Customizing Rules for MCP Tools

You can create or modify `.clinerules` files to define specific behaviors for MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. This allows you to enforce certain actions or provide specific instructions to the AI assistant when using these tools.
For example, you can use the built-in `"mcp-chat-history"` rule (`MCP - Chat History Recorder`) to ensure the [`record_chat_history`](https://github.com/henryalps/chat-history-recorder-mcp) tool is always called before completing a task. The rule contains the following logic:


```
# Execution Protocol

**ACTIVATION CONDITION:**
This protocol is only active if the `record_chat_history` tool is available in the current environment.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: The `record_chat_history` tool is MANDATORY before any concluding action.**
```

This helps in reminding the AI assistant to perform necessary actions, improving reliability and consistency.

## Usage

### Managing Project Rules

- **Add Rule from Bank**:
  - Right-click in the Explorer and select **Cline Rules: Add Project Rule from Bank**.
  - Or run the command from the Command Palette.
  - This will present a list of rules from your Rule Bank to copy into your project's `.clinerules/rules` or `.roo/rules` directory.
- **New Project Rule**:
  - Run **Cline Rules: New Project Rule** from the Command Palette to create a new, empty rule file in your project.
- **Edit/Delete Project Rule**:
  - Run **Cline Rules: Edit Rule** or **Cline Rules: Delete Rule** and select "Project Rule" to manage your project-specific rules.

### Managing the Rule Bank

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **Cline Rules: Manage Rule Bank**.
- This will open a panel where you can:
  - Add a rule from the bank to your current project.
  - Edit a rule template.
  - Delete a rule template (custom rules only).

## Updating the Rule Bank

The official Cline Rules bank is now managed in a separate Git repository. To get the latest updates, you can pull from the repository.

Run the following command in your terminal to update your local rule bank (default location `~/.cline-rules`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henryalps/cline-rules.git ~/.cline-rules-temp && cp -r ~/.cline-rules-temp/* ~/.cline-rules/ && rm -rf ~/.cline-rules-temp
```

If you have configured a custom path for your rule bank, replace `~/.cline-rules` with your custom path.

## Installation Requirements

- VSCode version 1.93.0 or higher
- Cline editor needs to be used in the project

## Plugin Settings

You can customize the path to your "Rule Bank" by setting the `clinerules.ruleBankPath` in your VSCode settings. If not set, it defaults to `~/.cline-rules`.

```json
{
  "clinerules.ruleBankPath": "/path/to/your/custom/rules/bank"
}
```

## Common Issues

1. **Rule file cannot be added?**

   - Make sure you have opened a project folder
   - Check if you have file write permissions
2. **Rule preview failed to display?**

   - Try reinstalling the plugin
   - Ensure your VSCode version meets the requirements
3. **Cannot find the option to add rules?**

   - Make sure to open the command palette using `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Enter "Cline" to quickly find commands
   - Or find commands by right-clicking on a folder

## Changelog

### 0.0.6

- **Enhancement**: When creating rules in a project with no prior setup, the extension now prompts the user to create a modern rule directory, with an option for the legacy single-file format.


### 0.0.5

- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where the "Manage Rule Bank" command would fail if the rule bank path was not pre-existing, particularly when using `~` in the path. The extension now ensures the directory is created on-demand.

### 0.0.4

- **Enhancement**: The extension now prioritizes a `.clinerules/` or `.roo/` directory for managing rules. The traditional single `.clinerules` file in the root is now used as a fallback for backward compatibility.
- **Feature**: Introduced the "Rule Bank" concept, a central location for storing rule templates.
- **Feature**: Commands are updated to distinguish between project rules and the rule bank.
- **Feature**: Added a configuration setting `clinerules.ruleBankPath` to customize the rule bank location.
- **Enhancement**: Improved command names and UI text for better clarity.

### 0.0.3

- Added new rules for backend frameworks: Spring Boot, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Express.js.
- Added a new rule category for MCP tools, including a rule to enforce the use of the `record_chat_history` tool.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new rules and provide examples for customizing MCP tool behavior.

### 0.0.2

- Published to vscode and open-vsx

### 0.0.1

- Initial version released
